description: >
    A workflow example that illustrates error handling. In this case, the "continue"
    command is explicit. When there is a task failure, the "continue" command will
    process the publish and then cascade the task failure to the workflow and the
    workflow execution will fail as a result.

input:
  - cmd


vars:
  - stdout: null


tasks:
  task1:
    action: core.local cmd=<% ctx(cmd) %>
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        publish: stdout=<% result().stdout %>
     

output:
  - stdout: <% ctx(stdout) %>
